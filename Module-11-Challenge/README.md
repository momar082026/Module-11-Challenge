Module 11 Challenge- Web Scraping

Background

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

The Starter_Code 5 folder contains the working project files and the output folder.

part_1_mars_news.ipynb contains the Jupyter Notebook file used to Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
part_2_mars_weather.ipynb contains the Jupyter Notebook file used to Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
The output folder contains the exported DataFrame file mars_data.csv.

Instructions:

Clone the repository.
Open up part_1_mars_news.ipynb inside Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
Run all cells for analysis.
Open up part_2_mars_weather.ipynb inside Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
Run all cells for analysis.
Open up mars_data.csv inside the output folder to view exported file.
